# AI Costume Designer

## OBJECTIVE
Hey ladies and gentlemen, tired of seeing the boring clothes options? <br>
Hey designers, run out of ideas and inspirations?

This generator will provide you endless clothes designs <br>
that havenâ€™t existed before.

This generator will be your inspiration,<br>
or at least it could be for your entertainment to the eyes.

**In short, it's a "this costume design doesn't exist"**.


## DATA
### WHY IMAGES FROM MUSEUMS?
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73181107/207151756-b6d6f8e7-fe0f-4ce9-87dd-8ebafd15ff56.png" width="500">
I immediately thought of using images from the museum. Because the costumes should be iconic enough to be picked by museums. There will be costumes from different eras and different cultures.

Furthermore, the costumes were shot in a very consistent style: put on a mannequin, hanging or lay flat.


And they have orgnized information which are very useful to sort out images (althoguh still need cleanup).

### SOME MUSEUMS OFFERS API:

API used:

- [MET API guideline](https://metmuseum.github.io/)

- [V&A API guideline](https://developers.vam.ac.uk/)

   NOTE: ...under the terms and conditions as set out [here](https://www.vam.ac.uk/info/va-websites-terms-conditions) in particular section 9.<br>

### COUNTS
I hand picked some keywords such as dress, robe, suit for locating images for training.

Currently my model is trained on: 

| Museum Name | MET | Victoria & Albert Museum | MFA Boston |
| :--------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Location | New York | London | Boston |
| Images Used | 2544  | 6588  | 996 |
| Usage | Public Domain | non-commercial personal and educational purposes | Public Domain |

## DATA PREPARATION
### GRAYSCALE
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73181107/207155533-5c4cb08e-fa1f-4b08-a859-a8e06e064590.png" width="100">
After inspection, I found out the grayscaled images have 3 channels, so in this case, the RGB channels should have the same value.


### UNRELATED TOPICS

After downloading the images, I noticed that there are some unrelated images due to the museums' searching algorithm. Since I stored the information about the costumes when scrapping, I was able to locate and filter the unrelated topics using other features such as object type.


### SQUARE THE IMAGE

I decided to use squared images for training. Cropping the image to the center will lose much important information of the costume, so two methods were tested to create a squared image.

- Mirror on the edge:

   For some resolution, the processed results are unacceptable.

- Stretch on the edge:

   Stretch on the edge looks good to me, so I used this method.

## MODEL

GAN is used for this image generation. <br>
 
The models were tested with NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

### BASELINE

trained with a very simple GAN (one layer conv2D + leaky RELU, strides 2, no maxpooling)

### ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE

Tried:<br>
add VGG as base layers for discriminator, different filters combination or kernal size, balance batch size and input size, train longer, etc.

### CURRENT BEST RESULTS

trained with a VGG style discriminator (2 layers of conv2D, followed by a maxpooling)

## SKILLS USED
The notebooks are named in order, indicating the working process.<br>
You will need to create folder to store images, csvs or files that genereated/scraped.

- Web scraping: requests, urllib
- Data cleaning: pandas
- Image processing: pillow. openCV
- Folder management: os
- Tensorflow/Keras


## NEXT PLAN
- More training images
- Use something like Conditional GAN to let users pick certain categories for generation
- Higher resolution output
- Try other generation model, such as stable diffusion
